# About The Project
Bulking Buddy is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between home chefs who produce healthy, high-protein meals and fitness-focused individuals who need convenient, nutritious food options. It creates a complete, end-to-end e-commerce experience within a local community and integrates a unique AI feature to provide daily, personalized workout advice based on the user's nutritional intake.

# ‚ú® Key Features
For Buyers (Fitness Enthusiasts)

Hyper-Local Discovery: Finds and displays high-protein meals from sellers in the user's immediate locality.

Seamless Shopping: A smooth and intuitive interface for browsing items, adding to the cart, and managing quantities.

Flexible Ordering: Users can choose between local Delivery (with a nominal fee) or free Pickup.

Order Tracking: A dedicated "My Orders" page to track the status of current and past orders.

AI Workout Planner: A unique, integrated feature that:

Calculates daily protein intake based on purchases.

Allows users to add other meals they've eaten.

Uses the Google Gemini API to generate a personalized workout plan for the day, tailored to the user's specific muscle group split and total protein consumption.

Customizable Workout Split: Users can edit their weekly workout schedule (e.g., Chest Day, Leg Day, Rest Day) to match their personal routine.

For Sellers (Home Chefs)

Easy Product Listing: A simple form for sellers to add new products, including details like price, protein content, and initial stock quantity.

Image Uploads: Sellers can take a picture with their phone's camera, which is automatically uploaded to Cloudinary to get a live image URL.

Order Management: A "Received Orders" dashboard to view and manage incoming orders, with options to "Accept" or mark as "Delivered".

Stock Management: A dedicated page for sellers to view and update the stock quantity of their items in real-time.
